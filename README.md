Bosconian for MEGA65
====================

Bosconian is a classic arcade video game that was first released in 1981 by Namco. Developed during the golden age of arcade gaming, Bosconian stands out as an innovative and engaging space shooter that left a lasting impact on the gaming industry.

Bosconian is known for its unique gameplay mechanics that set it apart from other space shooters of its time. In Bosconian, players assume the role of a starship pilot navigating through space in a top-down perspective. The goal is to clear a series of enemy bases, each packed with hostile ships, mines, and defensive installations. Unlike many other shooters, Bosconian's levels are not linear but rather open-ended, allowing players to explore and engage enemies on their terms.

The player's ship is equipped with both forward-firing lasers and torpedoes that can be launched backward. The dual firing options add a strategic layer to the gameplay, as players must carefully manage their ammunition and choose the right weapon for the situation. To advance through the levels, players must destroy specific enemy formations, destroy the enemy bases' core reactors, and avoid or eliminate the threats that come their way.

This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-Bosconian_MiSTer)
Galaga core which
itself is based on the work of [WIP).

[Muse aka sho3string](https://github.com/sho3string)
ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2023.

The core uses the [MiSTer2MEGA65](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65)
framework and [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
FAT32 support (loading ROMs, mounting disks) and for the
on-screen-menu.
